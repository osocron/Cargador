The construction and analysis of algorithms and data structures is a basic and very important part of modern computer science. Its importance increases also by the rapid development of more powerful and faster computers. All computer programs can be described as algorithms that operate on a structured set of data, or as a concatenation of such algorithms. To construct a large program with a reasonable time and space consumption it is essential to have efficient solutions to the problem parts.
