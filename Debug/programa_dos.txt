Algorithms generally involve repeating a series of steps over and over, as in the borrowing and carrying algorithms and in the long multiplication and division algorithms. The Everyday Mathematics program includes a variety of suggested algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Current research indicates a number of good reasons for this â€” primarily, that students learn more about numbers, operations, and place value when they explore math using different methods.
